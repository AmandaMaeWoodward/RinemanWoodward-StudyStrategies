*Right now, I have all of these seperate, I know they all need to go together, but I wasn't sure how to combine everything, what is my best option for that? Or, should they be separate?
Question 1: Do students in this class use effective study strategies? Hypothesis: We hypothesize that students will not report using effective strategies at the beginning of the course
```{r data cleaning, seperated study strategy data MC1 prior strategy}

Question 2: Will students use more effective strategies at the end of the course compared to at the beginning? 
We hypothesize that students will use more effective strategies as the semester progresses, compared to the beginning of the semester. 
```{r}

```

Question 3: Does the use of effective strategies correlate with overall class performance?
We hypothesize that students with effective study strategies will earn higher grades in the class
We hypothesize that students with effective strategies will earn higher grades on exams than those who use ineffective strategies

```{r}
cor(longdat$MC1_PriorStrategyUtility, longdat$Final.Grade)
#It wants it to be numeric for correlation. I remember you writing on the board 1, .5, and 0 I think to add values to high, mod, low utility. Would that be another if else? 
```

Question 4: Do studentsâ€™ expected grades correlate with the actual grades that they earned? 
We hypothesize that students expected grades will correlate with their actual grades 
We hypothesize that there will be a greater difference (expected - actual) for those with poorer study strategies than those with more effective strategies 
```{r}
cor(StudyDat$MC2_AnticipatedGrade, StudyDat$MC2_ActualGrade)
StudyDat$MC2_AnticipatedGrade<- as.numeric(StudyDat$MC2_AnticipatedGrade)
StudyDat$MC2_ActualGrade<- as.numeric(StudyDat$MC2_ActualGrade)
#I tried switching to numeric and it gave me an NA
```

Question 5: Do students find reflecting on metacognition useful? 
We hypothesize that students will find reflecting on metacognition useful more often than chance
